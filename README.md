# GraduationProject
This is my project for graduation.

<b>GraduationProject-Beta:</b>
  * Based on OpenFrameworks-0.9.8 and c++
  * This is a VS2015 project, you can open it by the SLN file
  * Basic addons: ofxFontStash; ofxImGui; ofxOpencv

<b>Before building this project you should know:</b>
  * If you want to run this project, you must download OpenFrameworks first.
  * And then you can copy all files of this project to the path of_v0.9.8_vs_release/apps/myApps, and update addons you need by projectGenerator-vs

<b>NOTE:</b>
  * At present, this project is not good enough and has a lot of restrictions
  * So I decided to leave no comment for now
