# GraduationProject
This is my project for graduation.

GraduationProject-Beta:
    ·Based on OpenFrameworks-0.9.8 and c++
    ·This is a VS2015 project, you can open it by the SLN file
    ·Basic addons: ofxFontStash; ofxImGui; ofxOpencv

    ·If you want to run this project, you must download OpenFrameworks first.
    ·And then you can copy all files of this project to the path of_v0.9.8_vs_release/apps/myApps, and update addons you need by projectGenerator-vs

    ·At present, this project is not good enough and has a lot of restrictions
    ·So I decided to leave no comment for now
